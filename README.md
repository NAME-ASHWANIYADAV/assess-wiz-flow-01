## 📄 Summary of Your Solution

Our project, **Edugenius**, tackles the problem of **creating and grading educational assessments efficiently and without bias**. It works by **leveraging AI to automatically generate question papers from a given text or topic and then objectively grade student answers, providing detailed feedback**. We built our solution using **[list key technologies, e.g., React for the frontend, Python with Flask for the backend API, and a machine learning model for text processing]**.

*(Note: Please update the "list key technologies" part to be specific to your project.)*
